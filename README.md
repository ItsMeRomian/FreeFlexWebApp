# YoungOnesWebApp
This started off as a web app to manage, view, calculate and share worked jobs via YoungOnes. 
A place to find out how much you made freelancing and what values to fill in the belastingdienst site. 
But after working on this for a while I also worked via other platforms such as Temper and Jobner. So the name YoungOnesWebApp is not really accurate.
